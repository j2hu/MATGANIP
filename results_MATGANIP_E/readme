containing the result predicted by MATGANIP.E and DFT calculation
in the training of MATGANIP.e, we perform a linear tranformation for the DFT results
to evaluate the performance of MATGANIP.e with the unit of eV per atom, we perform its inverse transformation for the predictive results and divide this value by the amount of atoms in the supercell.
